    <p> Minions are Fictional character that appear in the Despicable Me franchise, which started with Despicable Me (2010). They are characterized by their childlike behavior and unique language, which is almost intelligible at times.<br> 
    <br>
    They mostly speak incomprehensible gibberish, which is partly derived from other languages, including French, English, Japanese, Korean, Italian, Spanish, and German.
    <br>

    If you are a minion Fan. Use this translator to convert your language into Minions or Banana language.
